# Todo list

- PID control of the intake arm
- Intake roler code (note: uses Krackens) (WIP)
- colllect coral off of ground & detect when collected
- Shoulder works same
- Pivot is removed
- Algae & coral rollers are the same motor & system now (note: also uses Krackens)
- Re-tune set ponts & scoring routines
- Handoff logic (intake to claw)
- Maybe add climber (if possible, and design and manufacturing do it)
